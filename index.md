-----------------------------

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the computer vision lab ([CVlab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/)) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) working with [Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua/bio?lang=en) and [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann). 
I completed my PhD in 2019 at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [University of Montreal](http://www.umontreal.ca/en/) under supervision of [Christopher Pal](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=1ScWJOoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Pascal Vincent](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WBCKQMsAAAAJ). I held a short-term postdoctoral position at Mila and [Polytéchnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en) with Christopher Pal before joining CVlab.    

My broad research domains are developing machine learning and deep learning techniques for computer vision problems. In particular, I am interested in developing semi-supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and also disentangling factors of variation in deep learning models. My goal is to make deep learning techniques applicable to problems where few or no labelled data exist.

During my studies, I interned at Morgan Stanely as a trade technology analyst and at NVIDIA's Learning & Perception Research team (led by [Jan Kautz](https://research.nvidia.com/person/jan-kautz)) as a deep learning researcher. My PhD was partially funded by Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies ([FRQNT](http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/le-frqnt)).

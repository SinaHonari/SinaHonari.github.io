-----------------------------

I am a senior research scientist at the Samsung AI Center Toronto. Before, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the computer vision lab ([CVLab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/)) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Lausanne-Switzerland, working with [Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua/bio?lang=en) and [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann) for more than 3 years. 
I completed my PhD in 2019 at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and the [University of Montreal](http://www.umontreal.ca/en/) under the supervision of [Christopher Pal](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=1ScWJOoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Pascal Vincent](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WBCKQMsAAAAJ). After my PhD, I held a 6-month postdoctoral position at Mila and [Polytéchnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en) with Christopher Pal.    

My broad research domains are developing machine learning and deep learning techniques for computer vision problems. In particular, I am interested in developing semi-supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised learning techniques, by leveraging task-related, computer-vision, or auxiliary priors. My other areas of interest are multi-view geometry, 3D modelling, generative networks, and anomaly detection. The application of my projects has been in 2D landmark localization, 3D human pose estimation, medical image segmentation and domain adaptation, bias-mitigation analysis, image generation, visual question answering, animal action recognition, and road-obstacle and anamoly detection. 

During my studies, I interned at Morgan Stanley as a trade technology analyst and at NVIDIA's Learning & Perception Research team (led by [Jan Kautz](https://research.nvidia.com/person/jan-kautz)) as a deep learning researcher. My PhD was partially funded by Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies ([FRQNT](http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/le-frqnt)).
